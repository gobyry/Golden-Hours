#About

Created by Matthew Streib and Ryan Hui. This was created using React, Nodejs, HTML, and CSS. This website that tracks whether or not all three athletic facilities at the University of California, Santa Cruz are open by taking into account operational hours for each facility and federal holidays and school breaks. It also features links to the offical school page for each facility for a more detailed schedule. We created this for easier access and visibility to see if our facilities are open or not since using the official school site takes a longer time and is more complicated. 

Here is the offical link to the website:
